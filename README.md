# WHS Odd Day Bot
My school changed it's free period room from a constant one to a changing one, and only on half the days of school. <br>
I built this bot to remind me and my friends what day it is, as well as what room we need to go in. 

## Features:
![Slash Command Example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1015713914467651684/1045406193948037231/image.png) <br>
The slash commands /today, /tommorow, and /day [Days from now] exist and tell you the type of day we have! <br>
The bot also activates every day at 6AM accoring to the system it's running on.
